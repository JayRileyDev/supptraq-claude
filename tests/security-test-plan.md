# Security Testing Plan for Supptraq

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive security tests to validate all implemented security measures before production deployment.

## Test Categories

### 1. Authentication & Authorization Tests

#### Test 1.1: Route Protection

  - [ ] Access `/upload` without authentication → redirects to `/sign-in`
  - [ ] Access `/chat` without authentication → redirects to `/sign-in`
  - [ ] Access `/settings` without authentication → redirects to `/sign-in`
  - [ ] Access `/admin` without dev auth → redirects to `/dev-login`

#### Test 1.2: Page Access Guards
- **Objective**: Verify page-level permissions work correctly
- **Test Cases**:
  - [ ] Owner role can access all pages
  - [ ] Member with limited permissions gets access denied for restricted pages
  - [ ] Member with full permissions can access all allowed pages
  - [ ] Invalid users get account setup required message

#### Test 1.3: Token Validation
- **Objective**: Verify JWT token handling
- **Test Cases**:
  - [ ] Expired token redirects to sign-in
